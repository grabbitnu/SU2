  SU^2 (Stanford University Unstructured) v2.0.6
--------------------------------------------------

Computational analysis tools have revolutionized the way we design aerospace systems, but most established codes are proprietary, unavailable, or prohibitively expensive for many users. The SU^2 team is changing this, making computational analysis and design freely available as open-source software and involving everyone in its creation and development. 

--------------------------------------------------
  SU^2 INTRODUCTION 
--------------------------------------------------

SU^2 (Stanford University Unstructured) is a suite of open-source software tools written in C++ for the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDE) and performing PDE constrained optimization. 

The primary applications are computational fluid dynamics and aerodynamic shape optimization, but has been extended to treat more general equations such as electrodynamics and chemically reacting flows. 

SU^2 is under development in the Aerospace Design Laboratory (ADL) of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University.

  SU^2 PATH SETUP 
--------------------------------------------------

When make install is complete, please be sure to add the $SU2_HOME and $SU2_RUN environment variables, and update your $PATH with $SU2_RUN. 

For example, add these lines to your .bashrc file -

export SU2_RUN="your_prefix/bin"
export SU2_HOME="your_SU2v2.0/trunk"
export PATH=$PATH:$SU2_RUN

$SU2_RUN should point to the folder where all binaries and python scripts were installed.  This is the prefix you set with ./configure -prefix 

$SU2_HOME should point to the source code's trunk folder.  This is (..)/SU2v2.0/trunk

Thanks for building, and happy optimizing!
